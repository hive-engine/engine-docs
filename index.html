<h2>Welcome to the Hive Engine Developer Portal</h2>

There are two ways to interact with the Hive Engine:

<h3>1) via <code>custom_json</code></h3>

Send a <code>custom_json</code> operation to the main blockchain with the following parameters:

<pre><code>
  id: "ssc-mainnet-hive",
  json: [{
    "contractName": "NAME OF THE CONTRACT",
    "contractAction": "ACTION OF THE CONTRACT TO PERFORM",
    "contractPayload": { OBJECT THAT WILL BE PASSED TO THE CONTRACT ACTION }
  }, {
    "contractName": "NAME OF THE CONTRACT",
    "contractAction": "ACTION OF THE CONTRACT TO PERFORM",
    "contractPayload": { OBJECT THAT WILL BE PASSED TO THE CONTRACT ACTION }
  }]
</code></pre>

<h3>2) via <code>transfer</code></h3>

Transfer funds with the following json as memo:

<pre><code>
{
  "id": "ssc-mainnet-hive",
  "json": {
    "contractName": "NAME OF THE CONTRACT",
    "contractAction": "ACTION OF THE CONTRACT TO PERFORM",
    "contractPayload": { OBJECT  THAT  WILL  BE  PASSED  TO  THE  CONTRACT  ACTION }
  }
}
</code></pre>

 Note: The <code>id</code> is used to identify to which sidechain you want to send the transaction.  For Steem Engine, use <code>ssc-mainnet1</code>.
